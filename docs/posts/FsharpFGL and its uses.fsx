## Graph theory

One of the most important inventions of this century is the internet, a digital hub that offers the means of communication and interconnectedness all around the globe.
The world wide web is, true to its name, a literal web of connections that allow for an easy exchange of information.
It connects websites and servies with the us, the users.
Such an intracate web of connections can be called a network.
Graph theory is the study of networks, also called graphs, which showcase the connections between objects.
The vertices, points in the graph, are connected via the so called edges. 
In the previous comparison the vertices would be users and websites while the edges woud be if the websites are connected to each other or if the user has visited the site.
Another example would be the emergance of social networks.
Here, the vertices are represented by the people themselfs while the edges are formed if they follow each other.
